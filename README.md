Project Report: Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

1. Introduction

Stock price prediction is a critical area of finance and investing. With the advent of machine learning (ML), various techniques have been developed to predict stock prices more effectively. This project explores the use of TensorFlow and Keras for building a logistic regression model aimed at predicting stock price movements.

2. Objectives

- To develop a machine learning model using logistic regression for predicting stock price movements (up/down).
- To evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
- To gain insights into the relationship between historical stock prices and future movements.

3. Data Collection

Data was sourced from a reliable financial data provider, such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage. The dataset included:

- Historical stock prices (open, high, low, close)
- Volume of shares traded
- Date of each record

For this project, we focused on a specific stock, such as Tesla (TSLA), over a time frame of five years.

### 4. Data Preprocessing

4.1. Data Cleaning

- Removed any missing or null values.
- Filtered the dataset to retain only the necessary columns: Date, Open, Close, High, Low, Volume.

4.2. Feature Engineering

- Created features such as:
  - Daily returns: \((Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}\)
  - Moving averages: e.g., 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day moving averages.
- Created the target variable:
  - Binary target: 1 if the stock price goes up the next day, 0 otherwise.

4.3. Data Splitting

- Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

5. Model Development

5.1. Logistic Regression Model

Using TensorFlow and Keras, a logistic regression model was implemented:

6. Model Evaluation

  6.1. Performance Metrics

  The model's performance was evaluated using:

  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

7. Results

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test dataset. Other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also computed to understand the model's effectiveness.

8. Conclusion

The logistic regression model demonstrated a reasonable ability to predict stock price movements. However, it is essential to note that stock prices are influenced by various external factors, and machine learning models may not always capture these complexities. Future work could involve using more advanced algorithms like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy.
